# Tic Tac Toe

## JavaScript Course Project

### Introduction
This project involves creating a Tic Tac Toe game that you can play in your browser. The goal is to implement the game logic, ensure a functional game flow, and later integrate a user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS.

---

### Steps to Complete the Project

#### 1. **Console Game Logic**
- Start by building a working version of the game in the console.
- Implement the logic to:
  - Check for a win condition (all possible 3-in-a-row combinations).
  - Check for a tie condition (no available spaces left on the board).
- Avoid focusing on the DOM, HTML, or CSS during this step.
- User input is not required at this stage; you can manually call functions and pass arguments to simulate gameplay.

#### 2. **Gameboard Display Using DOM**
- Create an object dedicated to handling the display and DOM logic.
- Write a function to render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage. For testing, you can manually populate the array with "X"s and "O"s.

#### 3. **Interactive Gameplay**
- Implement functions that allow players to:
  - Add marks (X or O) to a specific spot on the board by clicking the corresponding DOM element.
  - Prevent players from placing marks on already occupied spots.

#### 4. **Enhanced Interface**
- Allow players to input their names.
- Include buttons to start or restart the game.
- Add a display element to show the results (e.g., which player won or if it was a tie).

### Key Features to Implement
- **Winning Conditions**: Logic to check all possible 3-in-a-row combinations for a winner.
- **Tie Conditions**: Logic to detect a tie when no spots remain on the board.
- **DOM Updates**: Dynamically update the board to reflect the current game state.
- **Player Interaction**: Handle clicks to place markers and ensure invalid moves are prevented.
- **Game Reset**: Provide a way to reset the board and start a new game.

---

### Tools and Technologies
- **JavaScript**: Core game logic and interactivity.
- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the game.
- **CSS**: Styling for the game interface.

---

### Challenges and Tips
- **Logic First**: Focus on getting the game fully functional in the console before integrating the DOM.
- **Modular Code**: Separate game logic from display logic for cleaner, more maintainable code.
- **Testing**: Test each feature thoroughly to ensure correctness and avoid bugs.

### Summary
By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game with:
- A robust game logic that detects wins and ties.
- An interactive interface that allows players to engage with the game intuitively.
- A clean and responsive design for an enjoyable user experience.

Happy Coding!
